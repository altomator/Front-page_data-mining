# Front-page-faces_data-mining

This work is a compagnon project of the [GallicaPix PoC](https://gallicapix.bnf.fr/). It leverages a dataset of heritage French periodicals  built under the [GallicaPix](https://github.com/altomator/Image_Retrieval) scope.


## Face detection pipeline
Various face detection tools have been applied to the front page illustrations of the [Excelsior](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32771891w/date) newspaper (1910-1943): IBM Watson Visual Recognition, Google Cloud Vision, OpenCV/dnn. See this [github](https://github.com/altomator/Image_Retrieval). Gender can be infered by some of the tools.

Both the detected faces and the genders have been manually corrected on the page samples used for the quantitative analysis.


## Analysis
The following charts mainly show the impact of the WW1 on the economy, through the quantity of ads published, and the evolution of transport techniques.
